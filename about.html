    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born in America, but moved back to China when I was 3 years old. I grew up in Shanghai, China. I always
        loved the vibrant, lively city of Shanghai. To pursue the best education, my family immigrated to America again.
        In high school, I tried Computer Science for the first time through AP CS Principles and was immediately
        captivated by it. I have poured my high school years into pursuing my passion for CS. </p>
