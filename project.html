                            This is a Scratch project. I orginally made it using Snap! with two friends at UC Berkeley.
                            We recreated
                            the classic arcade
                            Pong Game and added our own power-ups system, multiplayer mode, and challenge levels.

                            I have made many projects in Java, mostly remake of real life board games.
                            I made these projects working with my groupmates in Data Structures in school.

                            I have learned Unity for more than a year, and also received the Unity Certificate for Unity
                            Certified User: Programmer. I have created many projects from 2D to 3D.

                            When I first started coding, I made many mini-apps using Code.org. Now, I am learning to
                            make more advanced apps using Swift, Unity, and other tools.
