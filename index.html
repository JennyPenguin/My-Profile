                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Hello, I am Jennifer Zhu! I am currently a senior at Seven Lakes High School. My dream is to
                            become a successful software engineer! I started Computer Science in 9th grade. Now,
                            I am fully in love with CS and wish to pursue it as my life path. By the end of this school
                            year, I would have taken all seven Computer Science classes in our school. I have also been
                            to three CS summer camps at UT Austin and one CS summer camp at UC Berkeley.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always loved creating art projects as a kid. As a 3 years old, I would spend hours
                            drawing. I am happy to combine my creativity and love of innovation together to build my CS
                            projects.
                        </p>
