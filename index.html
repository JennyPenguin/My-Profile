                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Hello, I am Jennifer Zhu! I am currently a senior at Seven Lakes High School. My dream is to
                            become a successful software engineer! I started Computer Science in 9th grade. Now,
                            I am fully in love with CS and wish to pursue it as my life path. By the end of this school
                            year, I would have taken all seven Computer Science classes in our school. I have also been
                            to three CS summer camps at UT Austin and one CS summer camp at UC Berkeley.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always loved creating art projects as a kid. As a 3 years old, I would spend hours
                            drawing. I am happy to combine my creativity and love of innovation together to build my CS
                            projects.

                            This is a Scratch project. I orginally made it using Snap! with two friends at UC Berkeley.
                            We recreated
                            the classic arcade
                            Pong Game and added our own power-ups system, multiplayer mode, and challenge levels.

                            I have made many projects in Java, mostly remake of real life board games.
                            I made these projects working with my groupmates in Data Structures in school.

                        <p>
                            I have learned Unity for more than a year, and also received the Unity Certificate for Unity
                            Certified User: Programmer. I have created many projects from 2D to 3D.

                            When I first started coding, I made many mini-apps using Code.org. Now, I am learning to
                            make more advanced apps using Swift, Unity, and other tools.
