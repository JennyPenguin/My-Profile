        <h2>Unity Game Development</h2>
        <div class="demo">
            <p>
                I have been learning Unity for a year. I have made many projects in Unity.
                I have also earned a certificate as an Unity user.
                Below are some video links of me explaining my projects or a quick demo of the game. These are not the
                only projects I have made, but they are some of my favorite ones. I don't own the artworks or music in
                my project.
            </p>

                        <h3>Forest Terminator</h3>
                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is the 3D Unity game that I made together with my friend Angela. It has my favorite
                            environment out of all the games and apps I have built.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>The player can use the arrows keys or WASD to move around. They can also move the mouse to
                            control the camera view. The player must explore the magical forest and help save the
                            animals from the danger. There is a full storyline in the game, and the player can talk to
                            the animals to get clues to their next step. There is also a boss fight and challenges for
                            the player to overcome.s</p>

                            This is my newest 2D game. It's a platform game but with a full storyline and
                            also 2
                            different

                            player has to go through different planets in order to find the soliders. Each
                            planet is a
                            different level with different challenges. </p>

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>
                            This was one of my early 2D games. I added character animations for the first time.
                            It was
                            incredibly fun to draw the vibrating character and add all the settings.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>The player can use the arrows keys or WASD to move around. They have to jump to the
                            platform
                            before it disappears and randomly move to another location. The player can triple
                            jump. Once
                            the player fall down the screen, they lose.</p>

                            This is my remake of the classic aracde game Asteroids. This is the first time I added
                            particle systems to my games.
                        </p>

                            spawning. If the player gets hit by a asteroid, they lose a heart. Once they lose all 3
                            hearts, the game ends. The player may press the Space key to shoot at the enemies.</p>

                            This was one of my earlest 2D projects. It's a simple and relaxing clicking game.

                            This was my first 2D projects. It's a simple platform game, but it's very hard to beat.
                        </p>

                        <p>The player can use the arrow keys or WASD to move around while avoiding the slime obstacles.
