        <p>
            This project was originally created by Jennifer Zhu, Himani, and Carlos on Snap! at the UC Berkeley Computer
            Science Academy, and then I (Jennifer) transferred it to Scratch. I made all the artwork and my friends
            (Himani and Carlos) helped create all the sound effects and ideas. We had a lot of fun creating it! Hope you
            can all have fun too!
            This game is best played on the computer. There is a tutorial in the game that explains all the different
            gameplay and levels. Please read it to fully enjoy the game!
